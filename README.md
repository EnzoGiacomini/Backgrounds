# Backgrounds
The game is an attempt to create a horror game. It was my first project using 3D on Unity, so it's pretty simple.

## About the game
The mechanic is pretty close to the most famous horror game - Slenderman.
You will spawn at almost the center of the map; on your left there will be a paper on the wall. The moment you take it, the game will start; in other words, the monster will start following you!!
While you are looking for the other papers, make sure you don't get lost or in a no-escape room!

### Scripts

- HudManger - Controls the HUD.
- Monster - Controls the monster mechanics.
- Paper - Controls the mechanic of taking papers.

**OBS**
The First Person Controller is from the Unity Assets Store!
